# Design Patterns Exercise: Weather Problem
## Check temperature below 5 degrees.

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Open the project in ECLIPSE
- Review The class structure and build the program

## Design Patterns that needs to be used:

- Observer - When getting the information of the weather we need to observe the changes and display an alert if the temperature is below 5 degrees, another observer will be checking if the temperature is greater than 10 degrees.

- Singleton - We need to use the singleton to keep the new information of the weather.
